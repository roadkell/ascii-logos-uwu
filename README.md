### Notes ###

* There are Unicode symbols in use beyond the classic charset of ASCII codepage 437 (notably, [Block Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements) and [Symbols for Legacy Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_for_Legacy_Computing)), so make sure your terminal emulator and font support them. For example, [Unifont Upper](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html) (`fonts-unifont` package in Ubuntu, `font-gnu-unifont` in Homebrew) and [Code2001](https://www.code2001.com/code2001.htm) fonts have the necessary glyphs. If images look distorted, try `*-lowres.txt` versions ‚Äî they only use symbols from Unicode 1.0-3.2 which are likely supported ubiquitously.
* These are not proper ANSI colors, they use [Neofetch ASCII file format](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Custom-Ascii-art-file-format) which is quite color-limited. This will change when Neofetch [implements](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/issues/1699) [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24-bit). Also, colorless versions are available in `bw` folder.
* Enjoy!

### To do ###

* Make low-res versions restricted to the charset of ASCII CP437.
